# Project Description
I was attempting to take the text and change it to still follow a similar syntactical structure, but in a different form. For example, I was attempting to change the conditional "if" from changing the article of the sentence to make one of the subjects 'grapes' change from 'grapes is' to 'grapes are'. I failed. Repeatedly. But I tried. I also added another 'choice' function in order to do this, by adding a 'verb' catergory containing only 'is'. Is only one choice truly a choice? Apparently it is in programming, because that didn't break the  code. I had a number of syntax errors in the code again and again and again and had to just go back and figure out where I was going wrong.  How do I change the grapes is to grapes are? Also, I didn't like how many time '.' was an option for conjunctions, so I got rid of a bunch of them. I ended changing the grammar of the end result while attempting to make subject/verb agreement. Not what I was going for, but it was fun practice. Also, please note, there are two .py files. "freeproject" is the finished file and 'project 1 code' includes all of my mistakes and attempts to run it until I got a random 'grapes'.
